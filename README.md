## Statistical Inference (Skills Demo Project): Simulation & Inferential Data Analysis

In this project, based on the *mtcars* dataset (from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine) we are interested in the comprehension of the relationships between dataset's cars' fuel consumption and a set of variables, trying, in particular, to model and quantify the one between the consumption and the car's transimission type.

The project was carried out as a final (peer-reviewed) assignment  within the Coursera course [Regression Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/regression-models/) of the [Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization](http://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) in September 2019
